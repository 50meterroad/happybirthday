                    <p>Happy 15th. I hope you like this. If you don't, just suck it up 
                       and pretend you do. I have spent a lot of time 
                       doing this. Hopefully you lke the idea of a whole
                       website dedicated to your birthday. My most 
                       recent regret is not spending more time with you
                       on the stairs the day you 'fell in front of the
                       whole class'. Lmao. Spy. If at the end this 
                       will be nothing more than two parallel lines, 
                       so be it. You're the only friend I need,
                       as Lorde said. Me and you. There are times when
                       I look at the people in our class and think that we
                       possibly have one of the best bonds ever. I genuinely 
                       do think that. THIS isn't toxic. Half of the others are.</p>

                    <p>You're the only friend I need. I cannot put into
                     words how much this friendship means to me. It is
                      the purest bond I experience daily. Do you remember
                       one time when we were in class 4 I think, the teacher
                        told us an idiom and it was- blood is thicker than
                         water. Meaning blood as in blood relations and 
                         water as in friendship. Blood relations > Friendship. 
                         That is sooo untrue. In fact, the full idiom is 
                         'The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water
                          of the womb'. Chosen bonds are greater than the ones 
                          that exist by default. And I agree. I hope that one
                           day we get to do all that we dream of doing now. 
                           Going places together. Hanging out. One day.
                            I love you. Enjoy your day. Happy birthday. </p>
